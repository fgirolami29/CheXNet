This warning indicates that there is an attempt to change the number of intra-thread parallelism (e.g., setting `torch.set_num_threads`) after parallel operations have already begun, which isn’t allowed once the parallel backend has been initialized. This issue often occurs with data loaders or other multi-threaded operations in PyTorch.

Here are some solutions to address this warning:

### Solution 1: Set Number of Threads Early
Set the number of threads before any parallelized PyTorch code executes. Add this code at the very top of `chexnet_train.py`:

```python
import torch
torch.set_num_threads(4)  # Set to your preferred number of threads
torch.set_num_interop_threads(4)  # Optional, controls interop parallelism
```

Adjust the number (`4` in this example) based on your system’s CPU capability.

### Solution 2: Use DataLoader with Fewer Workers
Since multiple workers in `DataLoader` can lead to this warning, try reducing the `num_workers` parameter when initializing the `DataLoader`:

```python
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True, num_workers=2, pin_memory=True)
```

Setting `num_workers` to `2` or `1` (or even `0` to disable parallel loading) can reduce these warnings.

### Solution 3: Ignore the Warning (Optional)
If the warnings don’t impact performance and you prefer to ignore them, you could suppress them using the `warnings` library:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Cannot set number of intraop threads after parallel work has started")
```

### Summary
The first solution (setting the number of threads early) is generally the most effective. Reducing `num_workers` in `DataLoader` also helps reduce the issue by minimizing parallelism at the data loading level.
