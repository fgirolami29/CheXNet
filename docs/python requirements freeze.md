## Steps to Activate the Virtual Environment and Generate `requirements.txt`

### 1. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv chexnet-env
```

Then, activate the environment based on your operating system.

#### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
source path_to_your_env/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
path_to_your_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Generate `requirements.txt` from Installed Packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can generate a `requirements.txt` file with all installed packages by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will save all the currently installed packages and their versions to a `requirements.txt` file, which can be used to recreate the environment later.

3. **Install from `requirements.txt` in a New Environment (if needed)**:

Later, if you need to set up a new environment with the same packages, you can install from this `requirements.txt` file by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
