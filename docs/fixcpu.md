The error you encountered (`RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for DataParallel`) is due to a mismatch between the keys in the model's state dictionary and the expected keys when loading the model. This issue typically arises when a model trained with `torch.nn.DataParallel` is loaded on a single GPU or without `DataParallel`.

Here are some ways to resolve it:

1. **Remove `module.` Prefix**:
   When using `DataParallel`, all keys in the state dictionary are prefixed with `module.`. You can remove this prefix when loading the model.

   Add this code snippet before loading the state dict:
   ```python
   state_dict = checkpoint['state_dict']
   from collections import OrderedDict
   new_state_dict = OrderedDict()
   for k, v in state_dict.items():
       name = k[7:] if k.startswith("module.") else k  # remove `module.` if it exists
       new_state_dict[name] = v
   model.load_state_dict(new_state_dict)
   ```

2. **Use `torch.load` with `strict=False`**:
   This approach tells PyTorch to ignore any keys that donâ€™t match perfectly. You can load the state dictionary with `strict=False` to bypass missing or unexpected keys:
   ```python
   model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'], strict=False)
   ```

3. **Use `DataParallel` if Multi-GPU Setup is Available**:
   If you are loading the model on a multi-GPU setup and want to use `DataParallel`, make sure to wrap your model as follows:
   ```python
   model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)
   model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
   ```

Try one of these solutions based on your setup, and let me know if the issue persists!
